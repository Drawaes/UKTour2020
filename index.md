## About speakers and talks

Speakers listed in alphabetical order.

More details coming soon ...



### [Bill Wagner](https://twitter.com/billwagner)

Content developer for C# and .NET Core at Microsoft. Based in USA.



### [David Wengier](https://twitter.com/davidwengier)

Developer on the .NET Project System in Visual Studio team at Microsoft. Based in Melbourne, Australia.

A developer for the last 20 years, David has had experience in lots of different languages and environments, from cgi-bin scripts in Perl, to genetic algorithms in VB3, and Windows applications in COBOL. A series of terrible decisions, clearly, but he learnt in the end and now spends most of his time developing with .NET in C#, and enabling other developers to do the same.

David is is mostly interested in C#, good design and Lego Technic and Creator Expert cars. He can be found tweeting at @davidwengier, helping to organize the DDD Melbourne conference, and on about a half dozen different slacks.

**Abstract:** TODO



### [Dean Ward](https://twitter.com/deanward81)

Developer at Stack Overflow. Based in UK.



### [Diego Colombo](https://twitter.com/colombod) - Introduction to .NET interactive in Jupyter notebooks

Developer on the .NET Interactive team at Microsoft. Based in UK.

Over the past 20 years Diego has been working in lots of different industries using .NET technologies in video games, finance and robotics. With a researcher background he still gives presentations and lectures in Universities around Europe.

**Abstract:**

.NET interactive brings interactive development and notebooks experience to .NET developers. This talk will introduce the project and tools. We will cover the how to get started, the basics and some of the feature available out of the box.



### [Irina Scurtu](https://twitter.com/irina_scurtu)

Microsoft MVP. Based in Romania.



### [Isaac Abraham](https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham) - SAFE Stack - The Pit of Success for Functional Web Programming

F# MVP, .NET and Azure consultant. Based in Germany.

Isaac Abraham is an. NET MVP and a .NET developer since .NET 1.0 with an interest in cloud computing and distributed data problems. He is the author of Get Programming with F# and is the director of Compositional IT. He specializes in consultancy, training and development, helping customers adopt high-quality, functional-first solutions on the .NET platform.

**Abstract:**

SAFE stack is an free, open-source, flexible end-to-end, functional-first stack for cloud-ready web applications that emphasizes type-safe programming. It allows you to develop web applications almost entirely in F#, without needing to compromise and shoehorn your codebase into an object-oriented framework or library, and without needing you to be an expert in CSS or HTML to create compelling, rich client-side web applications. This talk will demonstrate the value proposition behind the SAFE Stack, illustrating how we can develop unified client / server applications that take the best features of F# and apply them throughout the stack - such as type safety, succinctness, productivity and performance - whilst still integrating naturally with technologies and frameworks such as ASP .NET, JavaScript and React. You'll see how to create data driven server-side APIs quickly and easily, and then surface those APIs in a rich, responsive web application running in the browser, using a combination of .NET and JavaScript libraries and tools that come together beautifully. Lastly, we'll see how easily SAFE apps can be hosted on a cloud platform such as Microsoft Azure.



### [Karel Zikmund](https://twitter.com/ziki_cz) - Async demystified

Engineering manager on .NET Libraries team at Microsoft. Based in Redmond, USA.

Karel is on .NET team since 2005:
* Started as developer on Runtime/CLR components (7 years).
* Manager of reliability and performance team (incl. Quick Response Team) (3 years).
* Manager of .NET Native toolchain team (1 year).
* Now in the roles of community manager of CoreFX repo and manager of a few CoreFX/BCL areas like Networking (3 years).

Details: [https://karelz.github.io](https://karelz.github.io)

**Abstract:**

Do you struggle to fully understand async in C#? How it works and why?

I did. So I asked the best - the author of async, Stephen Toub. This talk is summary of the most interesting insights from him that helped me finally truly understand the magic behind async.

The talk will cover:
* History and evolution of asynchronous programming patterns in C# and their problems. Leading to async and demonstrating the "why" behind its design choices.
* Touch on the "how" it works behind the scenes.
* Reasons for customizing and hyper-optimizing async for high-performance (like Networking stack).
* Touch on related building block - ThreadPool.
* Hands on sync-over-async pattern and associated problems. Workarounds in your code if you hit it. Potential solutions in future .NET versions.



### [Luce Carter](https://twitter.com/LuceCarter1) - Zero to Mobile Hero - Intro to Xamarin and Cognitive Services

Luce is a Microsoft MVP, Twilio Champion and lover of code, sunshine and trains, based in Manchester, England.

When not writing mobile apps for fun in her spare time, she curates the Xamarin Weekly newsletter, edits for James Montemagno and speaks at events around the UK and Europe.

Follow Luce on Twitter [@LuceCarter1](https://twitter.com/LuceCarter1) and also her Blog at [lucecarter.co.uk](https://lucecarter.co.uk/)

**Abstract:**

You can be faced with a nightmare of Xcode, Android Studio, Swift, Objective C, and other options. This means not only learning multiple languages and frameworks but also having to support two different codebases for the same application. But Xamarin Native and Xamarin.Forms offer a powerful, cross-platform development solution for .NET developers looking to target smartphones, tablets, TVâ€™s, computers and IoT devices.

In this talk, Luce shares what Xamarin is including Native and Xamarin.Forms for both C# and F#, how to get started creating a simple HelloWorld app from scratch and a more complex example (will involve at least one Azure service including Cognitive Services for facial recognition). Also some awesome examples of apps written using Xamarin including ones used to save lives!

Luce will take examples from [xamarin.com/customers](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/customers) as well as show this demo about how Xamarin was used alongside other technologies to aid with Skin Cancer prediction.

This talk will include slides, demos, code samples, live coding and the audience will walk away feeling like they too can create a mobile app in just a few minutes and carry their work around with them in their pocket or backpack!
