## About speakers and talks

Speakers listed in alphabetical order.

More details coming soon ...



### [David Wengier](https://twitter.com/davidwengier) - A (very) opinionated guide to MSBuild and Project Files

Developer on the .NET Project System in Visual Studio team at Microsoft. Based in Melbourne, Australia, mostly interested in C#, good design and Lego Technic and Creator Expert cars. He can be found tweeting at @davidwengier, streaming at https://twitch.tv/davidwengier, helping to organize the DDD Melbourne conference, and on about a half dozen different slacks.

A developer for the last 20 years, David has had experience in lots of different languages and environments, from cgi-bin scripts in Perl, to genetic algorithms in VB3, and Windows applications in COBOL. A series of terrible decisions, clearly, but he learnt in the end and now spends most of his time developing with .NET in C#, and enabling other developers to do the same.

**Abstract:**

In this session we’ll dive into SDK-style project files and MSBuild to show you some of the techniques used by the .NET Project System team, and most of the rest of the dotnet org on GitHub, to make your project files easy to manage, author and maintain, make it easy to start new projects, and perhaps most importantly show you how to diagnose issues with your builds. Come and hear all of the things I wish David wished he knew about before joining the project system team, and hopefully you’ll be able to improve your project/build environment as a result.



### [Dean Ward](https://twitter.com/deanward81) - Building Stack Overflow for Teams

Principal developer on the Architecture Team at Stack Overflow working remotely out of Brighton, UK.

**Abstract:**

How we scaled Stack Overflow for extreme multi-tenancy. A whistle stop tour of tweaking code, infrastructure and everything else we could think of to make a 10 year old monolith play well in a new and operationally very different environment.



### [Diego Colombo](https://twitter.com/colombod) - Introduction to .NET interactive in Jupyter notebooks

Developer on the .NET Interactive team at Microsoft. Based in UK.

Over the past 20 years Diego has been working in lots of different industries using .NET technologies in video games, finance and robotics. With a researcher background he still gives presentations and lectures in Universities around Europe.

**Abstract:**

.NET interactive brings interactive development and notebooks experience to .NET developers. This talk will introduce the project and tools. We will cover the how to get started, the basics and some of the feature available out of the box.



### [Irina Scurtu](https://twitter.com/irina_scurtu) - Forget about HTTP

Microsoft MVP. Based in Romania.

**Abstract:**

Microservices should be autonomous and independent, but what happens when your business domain doesn’t allow it, and you need to get data from other microservices? You’ll soon realize that simple HTTP calls are not enough anymore, or that your app is more brittle than ever and then you switch to messaging. With messaging you need to have a different mindset and be willing to embrace new challenges.

In this session, we’ll see what other options we have and we’ll talk about the benefits or the drawbacks of choosing an approach or another.



### [Isaac Abraham](https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham) - SAFE Stack - The Pit of Success for Functional Web Programming

F# MVP, .NET and Azure consultant. Based in Germany.

Isaac Abraham is an. NET MVP and a .NET developer since .NET 1.0 with an interest in cloud computing and distributed data problems. He is the author of Get Programming with F# and is the director of Compositional IT. He specializes in consultancy, training and development, helping customers adopt high-quality, functional-first solutions on the .NET platform.

**Abstract:**

SAFE stack is an free, open-source, flexible end-to-end, functional-first stack for cloud-ready web applications that emphasizes type-safe programming. It allows you to develop web applications almost entirely in F#, without needing to compromise and shoehorn your codebase into an object-oriented framework or library, and without needing you to be an expert in CSS or HTML to create compelling, rich client-side web applications. This talk will demonstrate the value proposition behind the SAFE Stack, illustrating how we can develop unified client / server applications that take the best features of F# and apply them throughout the stack - such as type safety, succinctness, productivity and performance - whilst still integrating naturally with technologies and frameworks such as ASP .NET, JavaScript and React. You'll see how to create data driven server-side APIs quickly and easily, and then surface those APIs in a rich, responsive web application running in the browser, using a combination of .NET and JavaScript libraries and tools that come together beautifully. Lastly, we'll see how easily SAFE apps can be hosted on a cloud platform such as Microsoft Azure.



### [Karel Zikmund](https://twitter.com/ziki_cz) - Async demystified

Engineering manager on .NET Libraries team at Microsoft. Based in Redmond, USA.

Karel is on .NET team since 2005:
* Started as developer on Runtime/CLR components (7 years).
* Manager of reliability and performance team (incl. Quick Response Team) (3 years).
* Manager of .NET Native toolchain team (1 year).
* Now in the roles of community manager of CoreFX repo and manager of a few CoreFX/BCL areas like Networking (3 years).

Details: [https://karelz.github.io](https://karelz.github.io)

**Abstract:**

Do you struggle to fully understand async in C#? How it works and why?

I did. So I asked the best - the author of async, Stephen Toub. This talk is summary of the most interesting insights from him that helped me finally truly understand the magic behind async.

The talk will cover:
* History and evolution of asynchronous programming patterns in C# and their problems. Leading to async and demonstrating the "why" behind its design choices.
* Touch on the "how" it works behind the scenes.
* Reasons for customizing and hyper-optimizing async for high-performance (like Networking stack).
* Touch on related building block - ThreadPool.
* Hands on sync-over-async pattern and associated problems. Workarounds in your code if you hit it. Potential solutions in future .NET versions.



### [Luce Carter](https://twitter.com/LuceCarter1) - Zero to Mobile Hero - Intro to Xamarin and Cognitive Services

Luce is a Microsoft MVP, Twilio Champion and lover of code, sunshine and trains, based in Manchester, England.

When not writing mobile apps for fun in her spare time, she curates the Xamarin Weekly newsletter, edits for James Montemagno and speaks at events around the UK and Europe.

Follow Luce on Twitter [@LuceCarter1](https://twitter.com/LuceCarter1) and also her Blog at [lucecarter.co.uk](https://lucecarter.co.uk/)

**Abstract:**

You can be faced with a nightmare of Xcode, Android Studio, Swift, Objective C, and other options. This means not only learning multiple languages and frameworks but also having to support two different codebases for the same application. But Xamarin Native and Xamarin.Forms offer a powerful, cross-platform development solution for .NET developers looking to target smartphones, tablets, TV’s, computers and IoT devices.

In this talk, Luce shares what Xamarin is including Native and Xamarin.Forms for both C# and F#, how to get started creating a simple HelloWorld app from scratch and a more complex example (will involve at least one Azure service including Cognitive Services for facial recognition). Also some awesome examples of apps written using Xamarin including ones used to save lives!

Luce will take examples from [xamarin.com/customers](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/customers) as well as show this demo about how Xamarin was used alongside other technologies to aid with Skin Cancer prediction.

This talk will include slides, demos, code samples, live coding and the audience will walk away feeling like they too can create a mobile app in just a few minutes and carry their work around with them in their pocket or backpack!

**Abstract:**

.NET continues to evolve - but how did it get here? Join Richard Campbell on a tour of the history of .NET, Visual Studio and the related tools that have been helping developers produce millions of applications. So many forces shape how development tools are created, and Richard ties together the story of the hardware, software, market and political forces that have brought .NET to be an open-source, cross-platform development platform. The winding path of .NET has been influenced by many things along the way, and the future looks bright!



### [Simon Painter](https://twitter.com/madSimonJ) - Hacking C#: Development for the truly lazy

I've been working as a .NET developer for over 14 years now in a variety of industries including government, retail and manufacturing. But as a coder, I've been playing with making computers do whatever my crazed imagination could devise since I was old enough to read my Dad's copy of the ZX Spectrum BASIC coders manual.

I've been speaking about Functional C# at various user groups and conferences around the UK, USA, and India, and am particularly interested in seeing just how far we can push the capabilities of C#.

When I'm not coding, or running after my two small children, I have been known to enjoy the classic series of Doctor Who, Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks, Cryptic Crosswords, and rather more coffee than is probably good for me.

**Abstract:**

I don't know about you, but I'm a lazy developer. What do I mean by lazy? I don't mean I don't want to do my work - far from it - I mean that I hate to write out a great deal of code to get the job done. I want to accomplish my goals with as little effort as possible.

One of my pet hates is writing enhancements that involve copying and pasting blocks of code, changing a variable name, then leaving everything else the same. I hate having to consider each and every possible null reference exception, and adding in a whole ton of boilerplate to handle it. I hate having to spent ages jumping back and forth in a legacy codebase, trying to understand what it actually does!

What's the alternative? In this talk, I'll demonstrate a way of working that avoids all this unneccesary work, and gives you more time to do something more productive.


### [Tim Seaward](https://twitter.com/timseaw) - Digging into the Bedrock framework

By day works in a place that he can't mention on electronic trading things he can't talk about. By night a .NET open source contributor that loves all things networking and protocols . Based in UK.

**Abstract:** 

After an abridged history of pipelines and Bedrock Framework, we will look at a basic implementation today. Then after getting our hands a little dirty looking at the internals we will discuss what the future holds for Bedrock and not only what Bedrock can do for you but what you can do for Bedrock.
